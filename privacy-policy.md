2. **Non-Personal Information**:

## Cookies  
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from websites and stored on your device’s internal memory.  

This Service does not use “cookies” explicitly. However, third-party services integrated into the app may use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You can disable cookies in your browser or device settings.

- Ensuring compliance with legal requirements.  

**We do not sell, trade, or rent children’s personal information to third parties.**  

### Third-Party Services  
We may use trusted third-party services to perform specific functions, such as data storage or analytics. These third parties are contractually obligated to:  
- Use information only for providing services to Espitalia.  
- Maintain strict confidentiality and data security.  

## Security  
We value your trust in providing us with personal information, and we are committed to implementing appropriate safeguards to protect it. These include:  
- Encrypting sensitive data.  
- Limiting access to authorized personnel only.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
